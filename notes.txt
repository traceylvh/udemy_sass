SASS and SCSS are functionally the same, output the same CSS

The difference is in the syntax
  SCSS looks more like CSS

SASS gets rid of semi-colons and brackets WHAAAAT

SASS - indentation is EVERYTHING

instructor prefers SCSS

=== Data Types ===

$sass variables - just like PHP! (oy)

sass auto converts RBG and HSL color values to Hex
  not if alpha channel included

$list can contain multi vars, multi lists

this seems to be a really terrible Udemy course so far. He types in a bunch of stuff,
does not show how it affects the actual design/DOM output at all, and then erases it all.
I'm super unhappy with this course.

%variable is a placeholder for multiple uses

I'm watching a Sass tutorial by a guy who hates Sass syntax. :(
