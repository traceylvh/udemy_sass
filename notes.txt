SASS and SCSS are functionally the same, output the same CSS

The difference is in the syntax
  SCSS looks more like CSS

SASS gets rid of semi-colons and brackets WHAAAAT

SASS - indentation is EVERYTHING

instructor prefers SCSS

=== Data Types ===

$sass variables - just like PHP! (oy)

sass auto converts RBG and HSL color values to Hex
  not if alpha channel included

$list can contain multi vars, multi lists

this seems to be a really terrible Udemy course so far. He types in a bunch of stuff,
does not show how it affects the actual design/DOM output at all, and then erases it all.
I'm super unhappy with this course.

%variable is a placeholder for multiple uses

I'm watching a Sass tutorial by a guy who hates Sass syntax. :(

=== Mixins ===

@mixin - create mixin
    @include - call back the mixin

this guy either gets brackets and parantheses confused or it's the opposite in the UK

add parentheses to mixin to add an argument. everywhere argument is used it will be replaced
with what is passed into the mixin

whoa, total timesaver for vendor prefixes

@content - not very clear in tutorial

=== Importing ===

you can import the stuff from other files, must use correct syntax
use underscores for partials (files)

I think I'm going to hit a semi-permanent pause on this tutorial since I'm attending a GDI Sass class weekend
after next.
